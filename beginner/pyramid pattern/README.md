## Pyramid Pattern

Creating patterns by using a programming language is not less than designing an algorithm for a beginner. One of the easiest patterns that you can create is a pyramid that looks like a triangle. So to get your hands on pattern programming letâ€™s start by creating a pyramid pattern using Python.

### Pyramid Pattern using Python

Writing pattern programs will help you improve your coding skills and problems based on pattern programs are also commonly asked in coding interviews. So the time spent on writing pattern programs will always be worthwhile. A pyramid pattern is like a triangle that is not empty, so to create such a pattern using Python you need to use for loops to design a pyramid structure using stars, numbers, alphabets, or any other symbol.

In the code, I have defined a Python function that accepts an argument as the length of your pyramid. So while running this function you have to give one argument only.

### Output

```
                  * 
                 * *         
                * * *        
               * * * *       
              * * * * *      
             * * * * * *     
            * * * * * * *    
           * * * * * * * *   
          * * * * * * * * *  
         * * * * * * * * * *
```

### Summary

I have created this structure of a pyramid using stars, you can also use alphabets, numbers or any symbol by replacing them with `"*"`. So this is how you can easily create a pyramid pattern by using the Python programming language.
