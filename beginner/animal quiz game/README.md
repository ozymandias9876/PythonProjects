## Animal Quiz Game

Are you a quiz fan? Would you like to make one yourself? In this project, I’ll walk you through how to create a quiz game with Python. I will create an animal quiz here. Even though the questions are about animals, this quiz can be easily changed to cover any other topic.

### The logic of Quiz Game with Python

The Quiz game asks the player questions about animals. They have three chances to answer each question you don’t want to take the quiz too difficult. Each correct answer will score a point. At the end of the game, the program will reveal the player’s final score.

This quiz game uses a function; a block of code with a name that performs a specific task. A function allows you to use the same code several times, without having to type everything each time. Python has a lot of built-in functions, but it also allows you to create your functions.

The program should continue to check if there are any questions to ask and if the player has exhausted all his chances. The score is stored in a variable during the game. Once all the questions have been answered, the game ends.

In the code, I’ll create the questions and the answer verification mechanism. Then, I’ll add the code that gives the player three attempts to answer each question.

### Output

```

Which bear lives at the North Pole?: penguin
Sorry, wrong answer. Please try again: polar bear

Sorry, wrong answer. Please try again: blue whale

Your score is 3
```

### Summary

Mix up your quiz! Make it longer or harder, use different types of questions, or even change the subject of the quiz. You can try some or all of these hacks and tweaks, but remember to save them as a separate Python file so you don’t mess up the original game.
