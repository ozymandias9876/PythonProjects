## Index of Minimum Value

Finding the index of the minimum value in a list or an array is one of the popular coding interview questions that you may get in any coding interview. Here you have to find the index of the minimum value instead of the minimum value. So if you want to learn how to find the index of the minimum value in a [Python list](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/29/python-lists-tutorial/), then this project is for you.

### Index of Minimum Value in a Python List

Python has a built-in function to find the minimum value in a list. You can also define your Python function for the same, but the question here is to find the index of the minimum value, where the index of the first value is 0. So hereâ€™s how you can define a Python function to find the index of the minimum value in a Python list.

The function implements an algorithm to find the index of the minimum value. It assumes that the list is not empty and the items on the list are in random order. It starts by treating the first item of the list as the minimum item, and then it searches for the smaller item to the right, and then, if it finds a smaller item as compared to the first, it resets the position of the minimum item. When it reaches the last item of the list, by following the same process, it returns the index of the minimum item.

### Output

### Summary

So this is how you can find the index of the minimum item in a Python list. It is one of the popular coding interview questions that you may get in any coding interview.
