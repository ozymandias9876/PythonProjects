## Hash Tables

Hash tables are like dictionaries in Python, they are data structures that are used to store and retrieve a large amount of data in the format of keys and values.

In computing, hash tables are one of the most important data structures that resemble [dictionaries](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/31/python-dictionaries-tutorial/) in the Python programming language. A hash table is based on the concept of hashing which provides a way to store and retrieve data efficiently in the complexities of time and space.

The concept of hash tables is widely used in applications such as:
 1. Database indexing
 2. Compiler design
 3. Caching
 4. Password authentication
 5. Error analysis and many more.

Hash tables are based on the concept of hash, which means using a hash function used to map key and values. Since it is used to map key and value pairs, it is commonly known as a hashmap.

### Hash Tables using Python

The hash table implementation is based on the concept of key and value mapping just like dictionaries in Python. In other words, these data structures are used to map each unique key to its value. When implementing hash tables, we need to make sure that each input key must go through a hash function that will convert its initial data type to an integer value called a hash.

Python comes with a built-in `hash()` function that speeds up the entire hash table implementation process.

### Summary

So here is how we can implement hash tables using Python. A hash table is an important concept of data structures and algorithms that is used to convert keys of any data type to integers and then map the keys to a unique value. It is a very efficient data structure in terms of both time and space complexity and can be used in applications such as database indexing, password authentication and many other complex applications that include key and value mapping.
