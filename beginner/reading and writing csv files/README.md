## Reading and Writing CSV Files

[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (Comma Separated Values) files are the most commonly used file format for importing and exporting big datasets. The reason why a CSV file is preferred over an Excel file is that a CSV file consumes less memory as compared to an Excel file. So while learning data science, you must know how to read and write CSV files. If you want to learn how to read and write CSV files, this project is for you.

### Reading and Writing CSV Files using Python

You can read and write a CSV file without using any Python module or a library. But as we use the [pandas](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/09/15/important-pandas-functions-for-data-science/) library to work with data, this project will teach you how to read and write a CSV file using the pandas library in Python.

So letâ€™s start by writing a CSV file. Here I will first create a sample data using a Python dictionary about the name and age of students, and then I will store that Python dictionary into a CSV file. Then, we will read the CSV file using Python.

### Output

```
      Name  Age
0    Brown   23
1   Carter   21
2   Carrie   25
3   Hodges   23
4  McMahon   22
```

### Summary

So this is how you can read and write CSV files using the Python programming language. CSV files are the most commonly used file format for importing and exporting datasets. So while learning data science, you must know how to read and write CSV files.
