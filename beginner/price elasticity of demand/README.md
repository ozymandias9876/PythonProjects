## Price Elasticity of Demand

Price is one of the most important factors influencing the demand for a product. Elasticity refers to the degree of response, and the price elasticity of demand refers to the degree of responsiveness of demand for a product due to the change in its price. We study the price elasticity of demand in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), but if you want to learn how to calculate the price elasticity of demand using [Python](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/06/19/fundamentals-of-python/), then this project is for you.

Price elasticity of demand refers to the degree of responsiveness of demand for a product to a change in price. Simply put, it means the degree to which the demand for a product changes with an increase or decrease in its price. For example, the demand for a product increases by 20% due to a 10% decrease in its price. This is what it means to change in demand with the change in the price of a product. And when you calculate the degree to which demand changes, itâ€™s called the price elasticity of demand.

To calculate the price elasticity of demand, you have to use the formula mentioned below.

**Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded / Percentage Change in the Price**

### Price Elasticity of Demand using Python

I start the task of calculating price elasticity of demand using Python by creating a small dataset that should contain data about the change in the price and the demand for a product.

### Output

```
   Demand  Price
0      20   2000
1      30   1800
2      31   1850
3      33   1700
4      30   1800
5      33   1700
6      35   1600
```

The first rows of the dataset contain the **initial demand and price** for a product, and the subsequent rows contain the change in demand and the change in the price of the product. Now we add two more columns as the **Percentage change in Demand** and **Percentage change in Price** by calculating them.

```
   Demand  Price  % Change in Demand  % Change in Price
0      20   2000                 NaN                NaN
1      30   1800            0.500000          -0.100000
2      31   1850            0.033333           0.027778
3      33   1700            0.064516          -0.081081
4      30   1800           -0.090909           0.058824
5      33   1700            0.100000          -0.055556
6      35   1600            0.060606          -0.058824
```

Now the last step is to calculate the price elasticity of demand **(% Change in Demand / % Change in Price)** by adding a new column to the data.

```
   Demand  Price  % Change in Demand  % Change in Price  Price Elasticity
0      20   2000                 NaN                NaN               NaN
1      30   1800            0.500000          -0.100000         -5.000000
2      31   1850            0.033333           0.027778          1.200000
3      33   1700            0.064516          -0.081081         -0.795699
4      30   1800           -0.090909           0.058824         -1.545455
5      33   1700            0.100000          -0.055556         -1.800000
6      35   1600            0.060606          -0.058824         -1.030303
```

### Summary

Price elasticity of demand refers to the degree of responsiveness of demand for a product to a change in price. Simply put, it means the degree to which the demand for a product changes with an increase or decrease in its price.
