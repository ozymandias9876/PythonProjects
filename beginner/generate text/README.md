## Generate Text

Text generation involves generating text using machine learning techniques. The purpose of text generation is to automatically generate text that is indistinguishable from a text written by a human. If you want to learn how to generate text with Python, this project is for you.

### What is GPT-2 Model?

GPT-2 stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2. It is an open-source [Natural Language Processing](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/01/13/process-of-natural-language-processing/) model created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). It can generate paragraphs of text with state of the art performance on many language benchmarks. It is also used for machine translation, question answering, and text summarization.

To use the GPT-2 model to generate text using Python, you need to install the Transformers library in Python. It can be easily installed using the pip command on your command prompt or terminal as mentioned below:

```ps1
pip install transformers
```

I hope you now have understood what GPT-2 model is and how you can install it in your Python virtual environment. You can read more about this model [here](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

Hi, My name is John Cena, I am here to see you. I have been here this entire time. I've worked. I've seen all these things. It's just, man, my life has changed because of you guys. You guys get to see everything, including my career, things like that. You guys have, you know, the most amazing stuff about me.
