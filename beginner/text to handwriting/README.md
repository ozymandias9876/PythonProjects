## Text to Handwriting

There are so many amazing features in a smartphone for typing today, like converting a user’s handwriting to text, but what if you want to convert text to handwritten text? If you want to know how to convert text to handwritten text, then this project is for you.

### Text to Handwriting using Python

As Python is a popular and open-source programming language, it provides libraries for almost any task you can think of. To convert text to handwriting, there is a library known as PyWhatKit in Python. It provides a lot of useful features, but the feature I’m most interested in is converting the text of a user’s input to handwritten text. If you’ve never used it before, you can easily install it on your system by using the pip command.

```ps1
pip install pywhatkit
```

In the code, I first imported the pywhatkit and OpenCV libraries in Python. Here pywhatkit is used to convert text to handwritten text and OpenCV is used to visualize the image in which we are writing handwritten text.

### Summary

So this is how you can convert the text of a user’s input into handwritten text by using the Python programming language.
