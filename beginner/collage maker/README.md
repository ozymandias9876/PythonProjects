## Collage Maker

A collage maker is a tool used to merge different images into one. It allows you to save and share images as a collection of memories. You must have seen an option to create a photo collage on your smartphone itself, but if you want to learn how to create a photo collage using Python, this project is for you.

### Collage Maker using Python

To create a collage maker using the Python programming language, you must first learn how to read and convert images to arrays using Python. To create a photo collage, you first need to read the images and convert them into arrays before merging them into a collage. You can learn all about converting images to arrays with Python from [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/06/08/convert-image-to-array-using-python/).

In the code above, I first imported the Image class from the Pillow library in Python, also known as the Python Image Library (PIL). Then in the next line, I imported the NumPy library which I will use to convert the images to arrays. Then in the next line, I have defined a Python function to take 2 images as parameters and the third parameter is used to take the name from which you want to save your collage made by the two images. 

To run this code, you first have to input the name of the two images that you want to use to create a collage in the function and then you have to enter the name you want to save the image as the third parameter. Once the code executes, it will save a collage of your images in the same directory where your Python file is.

### Summary

So this is how you can create your collage maker by using the Python programming language. You can modify it in several ways, for example, creating a GUI application that accepts two or more images from a computer and saves a collage to your preferred location.
