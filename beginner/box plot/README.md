## Box Plot

A box plot is a statistical [data visualization](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/05/18/most-important-data-visualizations-in-data-science/) technique for analyzing the distribution and patterns of numerical data points of a dataset. It represents quartile 1, quartile 3, median, maximum and minimum data points of a feature which helps to understand the distribution of the numerical values of a dataset. If you want to know how to visualize a box plot, this project is for you.

The box portion of a box plot contains three lines:

 1. the first line in the top represents quartile 3 of the data points, which means that 75% of the data lies below this point;
 2. the second line in the middle represents the median value of the data points, which means that 50% of the data lies below this point;
 3. the third line in the box plot represents quartile 1 of the data points, which means that 25% of the data lies below this point;
 4. the two horizontal lines below and above the box are known as whisker lines, the above whisker represents maximum value, and the lower whisker represents minimum value.

I hope you now have understood what a box plot shows you about a numerical feature of a dataset.

### Box Plot using Python

This is how to visualize a box plot using Python. I start by importing the necessary Python libraries and a dataset that we can use to visualize box plots using Python. Then, we will visualize a box plot.

### Output

0  230.1   37.8       69.2   22.1
1   44.5   39.3       45.1   10.4
2   17.2   45.9       69.3   12.0
3  151.5   41.3       58.5   16.5
4  180.8   10.8       58.4   17.9
```

### Summary

A box plot represents quartile 1, quartile 3, median, maximum and minimum data points of a feature which helps to understand the distribution of the numerical features of a dataset.
