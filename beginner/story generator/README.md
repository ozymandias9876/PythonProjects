## Story Generator

Do you think the most complex use of the random module in Python is random sampling? No, we can also generate random stories or anything beyond that using the random module. In this project, I’ll walk you through how to create a story generator with Python.

### Story Generator with Python

Our task is to generate a random story every time the user runs the program. I will first store the parts of the stories in different lists, then the `Random` module can be used to select the random parts of the story stored in different lists.

I first imported the `random` module and then I created parts of the stories in different lists, then I only selected the parts of the lists at random to generate a random story.

As a beginner, you look for creating software applications more, which is not wrong. But spending more time with programs which required you to think logically will always help you no matter what aspect of programming interests you.

### Output

```
A few years ago, a rabbit that lived in Barcelona, went to the university and made a lot of friends.
```

### Summary

There are a few areas where the code could be improved upon, but at a basic level, it meets many secure password generation requirements by today’s standards. As a newbie to Python or any other language, you should keep trying these types of programs as they help you explore more functions and in the long run will help you design your algorithms and doing a great job in coding interviews.
