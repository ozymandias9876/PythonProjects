## Animated Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is one of the most useful ways to analyze the relationship between two features. You must have used a scatter plot before if you are learning data science but have you ever tried to create an animated scatter plot using Python? If you want to learn how to visualize an animated scatter plot, this project is for you.

### Animated Scatter Plot using Python

When you want to analyze how one feature in one dataset is affected by another feature, you probably need to use a scatter plot. You can learn more about scatter plots and how to visualize them using Python from [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/20/scatter-plot-with-python/). Now coming back to the animated scatter plots, Pythonâ€™s [plotly](https://plotly.com/) library can be used to create animated graphs, so we can use the Plotly library to visualize a scatter plot using Python.

In the code, I am using a dataset provided by the plotly library itself. The dataset covers the GDP per capita of all countries. Here I am visualizing the GDP per capita of countries on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis. Once you run the code, you should see the animated output.

### Output

```

### Summary

So this is how you can visualize animated figures by using the plotly library in Python. The plotly library in Python is a very useful tool that can be used to create animated graphs using Python.
