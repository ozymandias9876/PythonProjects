## Text-Based Adventure Game

Text-Based Adventure Game is a very basic adventure game that any Python beginner can work on. In this project, I am going to walk you through how to make a very basic text-based adventure game with Python.

### What is a Text-Based Adventure Game?

A text-based adventure game is a completely text-based and very simple game. In this game, users have options to tackle a situation and with each input provided by the user, the game will continue to increase by putting more situations and more options. This is what a good task for a beginner to get their hands on.

In the section below, you will learn how to create a very basic text-based game with Python. Here I will show you the basic idea of how you can create this game and then you can modify or increase the size of this game with more situations and user inputs to suit you.

### Text-Based Adventure Game with Python

In the code, I am starting by asking for a user to enter his name. Then I am printing that the user is stuck at work. Then I again used a print statement to tell the situation to the user and the next print statement tells the user about the two different options he is having.

### Output

```
Enter your name: baba
Baba, you are stuck at work.
You are still working and suddenly you saw a ghost. Now you have two options:
1. Run
2. Jump from the window
Choose 1 or 2: 1
You did it!
```

```
Enter your name: maggie howler
Maggie howler, you are stuck at work.
You are still working and suddenly you saw a ghost. Now you have two options:
1. Run
2. Jump from the window
Choose 1 or 2: 2
You are not that smart
```

```
Enter your name: kristie
Kristie, you are stuck at work.
You are still working and suddenly you saw a ghost. Now you have two options:
1. Run
2. Jump from the window
Choose 1 or 2: 4
Please Check your input
```

### Summary

At last, I am just using the `if` and `elif` statements to show the results based on the input of the user.
