## Group Elements of Same Indices

Grouping elements of the same indices means grouping elements of two or more data structures according to their indices. It is a tricky problem for beginners and can be asked in any coding interview. If you want to learn more about grouping items from the same index, this project is for you.

### Group Elements of Same Indices using Python

To group elements of the same index, you will initially have two or more lists inside a list like [[a, b], [c, d]]. To group the elements of these lists, you need to create two new lists where you will store the elements of both the lists at index 0 [a, c] and index 1 [b, d]. That is the meaning of grouping the elements of the same indices.

### Output

```
[10, 40, 70] [20, 50, 80] [30, 60, 90]
```

### Summary

To group items of the same indices, you will initially have two or more lists inside a list like [[a, b], [c, d]], and you need to create two new lists where you will store the elements of both the lists at index 0 [a, c] and index 1 [b, d].
