## Internet Speed Test

You must have checked the speed of your internet connection once in your life using platforms like [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/). Have you ever thought about doing the same with Python? Well if you want to learn how to perform an internet speed test using Python then this project is for you.

When checking the speed of the Internet connection, the results are displayed as download speed and upload speed. **Download speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection downloads data from the internet and upload speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection uploads data to the internet.** So, calculating the download speed and the upload speed of an Internet connection sums up the Internet speed test.

### Internet Speed Test using Python

To calculate the speed of your internet connection using Python, you have to install a Python library known as **speedtest**. If you have never used it before then you can easily install it on your system by using the pip command.

```ps1
pip install speedtest-cli
```

### Output

```
Wifi download speed is  91695511.60632873
Wifi upload speed is  51333155.5936688
```

### Summary

Calculating the download speed and the upload speed of an Internet connection sums up the Internet speed test. Download speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection downloads data from the internet and upload speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection uploads data to the internet.
