## Backward for Loop

Using a `for` loop on any [Python](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/06/19/fundamentals-of-python/) object is very easy as compared to other programming languages like C++ and Java. But have you ever tried using a `for` loop backwards? Itâ€™s as easy as a general `for` loop that you use while iterating over any Python object. So if you want to learn how to use a backward for loop, then this project is for you.

### Backward For Loop using Python

`for` loop is used to iterate over any Python object. If you want to return the index of any values, then you should always prefer a `for` loop.

Python has an inbuilt function known as `reversed()` that can be used to reverse the order of a Python object while using a `for` loop.

### Summary

The inbuilt function in Python known as `reversed()` can be used to use a `for` loop backwards. So this is how you can easily use a `for` loop backwards in the Python programming language.
