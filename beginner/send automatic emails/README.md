## Send Automatic Emails

Every time you register on a new app, you automatically receive a welcome message with your name on it. If you want to learn how to send such emails automatically, then this project is for you.

### How to Send Automatic Emails using Python?

To send automatic emails using Python, you must first understand how to send an email using the Python programming language. Once you know how to send an email using Python, the next thing you need to figure out is what you want to send automatically. For example, many companies send [OTP](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/04/14/otp-verification-using-python/) or welcome messages, while some companies even send newsletters to newly registered users.

So in the project, you will go through how to send automatic emails using Python. You will automatically send a welcome message to the newly registered user. For this task, you must first generate a [google app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for your Gmail account.If you don’t know how to generate it, you can learn more from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndxUgivCszE&t=147s).

### Send Automatic Emails using Python

It is very important to generate a Google app password for your Gmail account, as you will be sending automatic emails using Python through your Gmail account.

In the code, you have defined a Python function that will automatically send emails to a newly registered user. This function will start by asking for the user’s name and email. Then the user’s name will be stored in the message. **Then in the 12th line of the code above, you need to replace the first parameter with your email and the second parameter with the google app password you generated before.** After that just run the code and you will see the output as shown below.

### Output

```
Enter your name: 
Enter your email: 
Email sent!
```

After filling in details to these user inputs you will get an email in your inbox as shown below.

```
Dear John Doe, Welcome to PythonProjects
```

### Summary

So this is how you can send automatic emails using Python. To send automatic emails using Python, you must first understand how to send an email using the Python programming language. Once you know how to send an email using Python, the next thing you need to figure out is what you want to send automatically.
