## Rock, Paper and Scissors

In this project, I’ll walk you through how to make a rock, paper, and scissors game with Python. In the rock, paper and scissors game our goal is to create a command-line game where a user has the option to choose between rock, paper and scissors and if the user wins the score is added, and at the end when the user finishes the game, the score is shown to the user.

### Rock, Paper and Scissors Game with Python

To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the user’s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the `random` module in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins then the score will increase by 1.

### Summary

Creating these types of games will help a beginner to think logically. You can even use this idea to make your own game. In the end, creating these types of programs will help you create your algorithms, which is a very important skill for coding interviews and competitive programming.
