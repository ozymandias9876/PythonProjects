### Remove Cuss Words using Python

In a research, it was found that on an average, 80-90 words that a person speaks every day, 50%-70% of all the words are cuss words. So it means people find it normal while exchanging conversations with cuss words. But sometimes, we need to remove such words from a piece of text to make it available to the audience of every age group.

So to remove cuss words, by using the Python programming language, we need to install the [better_profanity](https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/) library in our Python environment. It helps identify and remove the cuss words by inserting the * symbol in each letter of a cuss word.

To install this Python library in your Python environment, you need to execute the command mentioned below in your command prompt or terminal.

```ps1
pip install better_profanity
```

### Output

Please leave me alone and just ****
```
