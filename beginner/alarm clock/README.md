## Alarm Clock

An alarm clock is a clock with a function that can be activated to ring at a time set in advance, used to wake someone up. In this project, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to write a Python program to create an alarm clock with Python.

### How to Create an Alarm Clock with Python?

As the title suggests, our task here is to write a python script that creates an alarm clock. For this task, I will be using the DateTime module in Python to create an alarm clock and the sound library in Python to play the alarm sound.

The DateTime module comes preinstalled in the Python programming language so you can easily import it in your program. The playsound library can be easily installed by using a pip command; 

```py
pip install playsound
```

### Alarm Clock with Python

Before writing the program you should know that you also need an alarm tone which will ring at the time of the alarm. So you can download an alarm tune from [here](https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/alarm).
