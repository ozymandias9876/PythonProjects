## Number Guessing Game

The number guessing game is a popular game among programmers. In the number guessing game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number. If you want to learn how to create a guessing game using Python, this project is for you.

To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 and 10. To give hints to the user, we can use [conditional statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)) to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, greater than or equal to the randomly selected number.

If the guessed number is lower than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too low”. If the guessed number is higher than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too high”. When the user guesses the correct number, “you guessed it right!!” will be displayed in the output.

### Output

```
Enter any number: 16
Too high!
Enter number again: 5
Too low!
Enter number again: 7
Too high!
Enter number again: 6
You guessed it right!!
```

### Summary

So this is how you can write a program to create a guessing game using Python. It is a popular game among programmers. In this game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number.
