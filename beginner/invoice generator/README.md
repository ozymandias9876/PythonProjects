## Invoice Generator

An invoice is a bill that serves as proof of a transaction between a buyer and a seller. In this project, I will walk you through how to create an invoice with the Python programming language.

### Create an Invoice with Python

To create an Invoice with Python I will be using the basics of Python programming language. It is a beginner level task so it will help you to improve your coding skills. We donâ€™t need to make use of loops here, just print statements and formatting is all we need for this task.

I will start by declaring six variables as the name of three products and their price, you can add more products to your list. Then I'll store the name and address of a company which is very important to show at the top of a receipt, and I will store a greeting message in a variable to show at the end of the invoice. I will also create a border for the invoice, and print the name of the company in a tabular format. At last, I will pass the greeting message.
