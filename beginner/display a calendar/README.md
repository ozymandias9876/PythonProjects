### Print a Calendar using Python

There are so many useful built-in modules in Python that can be used to fulfil your goal in a few lines of code. One of these modules in Python is the calendar module which provides access to the calendar of any month of any year. Anytime you want to show a calendar to a user, this Python module will come in handy.

In the code, I have first imported the calendar module in Python. Then I have used the print function to print the calendar of November 2022 using the month function of the calendar module. You can also take user input as year and month, then you can use the user inputs as parameters of the month function of the calendar module.

### Output

```
   November 2022    
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
    1  2  3  4  5  6
