## Detect Questions

Detecting questions means identifying whether a sentence is interrogative or not. We can also use machine learning to detect questions, but since we all know the type of sentences we see in an interrogative sentence, it is also possible to write a [Python](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/06/19/fundamentals-of-python/) script to detect whether a sentence is a question or not. So if you want to learn how to detect whether a sentence is a question or not, then this project is for you.

### Detect Questions using Python

To write a Python program to detect whether a sentence is a question or not, we first need to create a list of words that we see at the start of an interrogative sentence. For example, `what is your name?`, `where do you live?`, in these two questions, “what” and “where” are the types of words we need to store in a python list. Next, to check if a sentence is a question or not, we need to check if any word from the list is present at the beginning of the sentence. If it is present, then the sentence is a question, and if it is not present, then the sentence is not a question.

### Output

```
Input a sentence: Do you have any feelings for me?
This is a question!
```

### Summary

I hope you now have understood how to identify questions or interrogative sentences using Python. We can also use machine learning for [detecting questions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akarshsinghh/list-of-sentences), but as we all know the kind of sentences we see in an interrogative sentence, so it is also possible to write a Python script for detecting whether a sentence is a question or not.
