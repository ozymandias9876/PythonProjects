## Sequential Search

The Sequential search algorithm is a searching algorithm. To implement this algorithm, we start by searching for the target value from the beginning of the array and continue till we find the target value.

### Sequential Search Algorithm

The searching algorithms are the algorithms that are used to search a particular value in a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) such as lists in Python. The sequential search is a searching algorithm that checks each item in a data structure from the beginning to find the target value.

For example, imagine that you are trying to find a specific card from a deck of cards. You will go through each card in the deck one by one until you find the card you are looking for. Once you got the card you were looking for you will stop. This is how the sequential search algorithm works.

### Sequential Search using Python

I hope you now know what a sequential search algorithm is and how it works. To implement this algorithm, we need to check each element from the beginning until we find the value we are looking for.

In the code, I have defined a Python function with two parameters(list_, n) the `list_` indicates the Python list and `n` indicates the item we want to search in a list. Then I am simply using a for loop to search for `n` in the list.

### Summary

The sequential search is one of those algorithms which are popular in every coding interview. To implement it, you have to search for the target value from the beginning of the data structure until you find the target value.
