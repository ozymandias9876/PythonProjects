## SequenceMatcher

SequenceMatcher is a class in [Python](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/06/19/fundamentals-of-python/) available in the [difflib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) module, which provides functions for comparing sequences in two different pieces of text. So whenever you want to compare two text files, you can explore the difflib module in Python. If you have never used the SequenceMatcher class in Python, this project is for you.

### SequenceMatcher in Python

The SequenceMatcher class is available in the difflib module in Python, which is available in the Python standard library. You do not have to install it before using it. There are many classes in the difflib module to compare texts. One of those classes is SequenceMatcher which calculates how well the sequence of two texts matches each other. In simple words, it finds similarities in the sequence of two different texts.

Let’s see how to use this class to find similarities in the sequence of two texts.

### Output

```
Both are 89.65517241379311% similar
```

So, according to the score above, it shows that both the text inputs have very similar sequences. Now let’s try it with text inputs that are dissimilar from each other.

```
Both are 20.833333333333336% simmilar
```

So, according to the score above, it shows that both the text inputs have less similar sequences. This is how you can use this class in Python available in the difflib module.

### Summary

The SequenceMatcher class is available in the difflib module in Python, which is available in the Python standard library. You do not have to install it before using it.
